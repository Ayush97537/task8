Steps Performed
1. **Import Libraries**: Loaded required Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Load Dataset**: Loaded mall customer data using Pandas.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Selected two key features for clustering (`Annual Income`, `Spending Score`).
4. **Elbow Method**: Applied the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting inertia vs. cluster count.
5. **Apply K-Means**: Trained the K-Means model and assigned cluster labels to the data.
6. **Visualize Clusters**: Created a scatter plot to show customer segments with distinct color coding.
7. **Evaluate with Silhouette Score**: Computed the silhouette score to measure the quality of clustering.
